        "# 1 **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2 **What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A class in OOP is like a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "  \n",
        "# 3 **What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Object is a specific instance of a class.\n",
        "  - A class is the blueprint (like the design of a car).\n",
        "  - An object is the actual car built using that design — it has real features and can do things.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4 **What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Encapsulation\n",
        "    - Hides data to protect object integrity\n",
        "    - Prevents direct access to internal variables\n",
        "  - Abstraction\n",
        "    - Hides the internal implementation\n",
        "    - Shows only what an object does, not how it does it\n",
        "  \n",
        "# 5 **What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, in Python are special reserved methods that are surrounded by double underscores (i.e., __method__). These methods allow you to define how instances of your classes behave when they are used with built-in Python functions or operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6 **Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Child inherit traits from parents (like eye color, hair type).\n",
        "  - In OOP, a class can inherit functions and variables from another class the same way.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7 **What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In OOP, polymorphism refers to an object's capacity to assume several forms.Simply said, polymorphism enables us to carry out a single activity in a variety of ways\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8 **How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A class's data members and methods can be made private or protected inorder to achieve encapsulation. Direct access modifiers like public, private, and protected don't exist in Python,though. Single and double underscores can be used to accomplish this.\n",
        "  - Modifiers for access control restrict use of a class's variables and methods. Private, public, and protected are the three different access modifier types that Python offers.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9 **What is a constructor in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A constructor is a special method that gets called automatically when you create an object from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 10 **What are class and static methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A class is a  method that belongs to the class, not just an instance. It can access or modify class-level data.\n",
        "  - A static method is a method that doesn’t depend on the class or instance\n",
        "  - It’s just grouped with the class because it’s related to it logically.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 11 **What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Method overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (number or type), so the method behaves differently depending on how it's called.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 12 **What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Method overriding happens when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 13 **What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The @property decorator in Python allows you to turn a method into a \"read-only\" attribute — meaning you can access a method like a variable, without using parentheses ().\n",
        "\n",
        "# 14 ** Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - enables code flexibility\n",
        "  - Supports code reusability\n",
        "  - Makes code cleaner and readable\n",
        "  - Allows extensibility without modifying existing code\n",
        "  - Follows Open/Closed Principle\n",
        "  - Promotes interface consistency\n",
        "\n",
        "# 15 **What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be subclassed. It's used when you want to define a common interface or structure for all subclasses, but leave some methods unimplemented, expecting subclasses to provide the implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 16 **What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Modularity – Code is organized into reusable classes.\n",
        "  - Reusability – Inheritance lets you reuse and extend existing code\n",
        "  - Flexibility – Polymorphism allows different behaviors with a common interface.\n",
        "  - Maintainability – Easier to debug, update, and scale.\n",
        "  - Security – Encapsulation hides internal details and protects data.\n",
        "  - Real-world modeling – Represents real-world entities intuitively.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 17 **What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Class Variable.\n",
        "    - Shared by all instances of the class.\n",
        "    - Defined inside the class, but outside any method.\n",
        "    - Changing it affects every object of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Instance Variable\n",
        "    - Unique to each object (instance).\n",
        "    - Defined using self inside methods (usually __init__).\n",
        "    - Changing it affects only that instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 18 **What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - One child class may inherit from several parent classes when there is multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 19 **Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - ‘’__str__’\n",
        "    - Meant to return a readable, nicely formatted string for end users.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - ‘__repr__’\n",
        "    - Meant to return an unambiguous string, ideally one that can recreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 20 **What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The super() function in Python is used to call a method from a parent (super) class. It’s most commonly used in inheritance to ensure that the parent class is properly initialized or that its methods are reused.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 21 **What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The __del__ method in Python is a destructor — it's called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e. when it’s garbage collected).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 22 **What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - @staticmethod\n",
        "    - Doesn't take any automatic first argument (no self or cls).\n",
        "    - Works like a regular function, just inside a class for logical grouping\n",
        "    - Can't access or modify class or instance state.\n",
        "    \n",
        "  - @classmethod\n",
        "    - Takes cls as the first parameter (the class itself).\n",
        "    - Can access/modify class variables or create new instances.\n",
        "    - Often used as factory methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 23 **How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In Python, if a parent class defines a method, and a subclass overrides it, you can call the method on any object (parent or child), and the appropriate version runs based on the object's actual class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 24 **What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object, all in one line. This works when each method returns self, allowing the next method to be called on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 25 **What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The __call__ method makes an object behave like a function. When you define __call__ in a class, you can \"call\" instances of that class using () — just like a regular function.\n",
