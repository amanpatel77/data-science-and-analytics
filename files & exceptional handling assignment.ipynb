        "\n",
        "  - Compiled Language.\n",
        "    - The code is translated entirely into machine code (binary) by a compiler before it’s run.\n",
        "    - Examples: C, C++, Rust, Go\n",
        "  -Interpreted language\n",
        "    - The code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime.\n",

        "# 2 What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Exception handling in Python is a way to deal with errors or unexpected situations that might occur while your program is running — without crashing the whole program.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3 What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - It ensures that certain code always runs, whether an exception was raised or not, an exception was handled or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "#4 What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Logging in Python is like your program keeping a diary or activity log — it records important events, errors, or status updates while the code runs. Super handy for debugging, monitoring, or understanding what happened and when.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5 What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - __del__ is a special method in Python that gets called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when it’s being garbage collected).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6 What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - import : You're bringing in the whole module, for eg like grabbing the entire toolbox.\n",
        "  - from ... import : You bring in just what you need, for eg ,like grabbing one tool from the box.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7 How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Use multiple except blocks to catch each exception type individually.\n",

        "  try:\n",
        "      x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",

        "    print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Handle Multiple Exceptions with One Block\n",
        "  - Group them in a tuple if they’re handled the same way.\n",

        "  try:\n",
        "    x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "    result = 10 / x\n",

        "# 8 What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
